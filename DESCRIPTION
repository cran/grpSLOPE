Description: Group SLOPE (Group Sorted L1 Penalized Estimation) is
    a penalized linear regression method that is used for adaptive
    selection of groups of significant predictors in a high-dimensional
    linear model. The Group SLOPE method can control the (group) false
    discovery rate at a user-specified level (i.e., control the expected
    proportion of irrelevant among all selected groups of predictors).
    For additional information about the implemented methods please see
    Brzyski, Gossmann, Su, Bogdan (2018) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2017.1411269>.
